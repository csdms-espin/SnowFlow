edited.ipynb is our final version of the overland flow code so far. I eliminated the need for CDS data.

Overland flow, particularly the infiltration-excess mechanism, is affected by the nature of water input through precipitation. This [Jupyter notebook](overland_flow.ipynb) demonstrates how to use the [CSDMS data component](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/DataComponents) to download the topography dataset and use the [Landlab](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/) components to delineate the watershed and simulate the overland flow for a study area in the Boulder County. 

If you have any suggestion to improve this notebook, please create a github issue 
[here](https://github.com/gantian127/overlandflow_usecase/issues).
