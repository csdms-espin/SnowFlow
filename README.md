_Goal:_ We hope to couple a snow melt model with the OverlandFlow model to model snow melt runoff (discharge at outflow of watershed). For the snow melt model we will use the Positive Degree Day model (PDD) which is discussed in the [MeltRate](./MeltRate.ipynb). The PDD model uses initial snow depth and density and temperature as inputs. We'll run this model under several different scenarios: a cool spring day, a warm spring day and a hot spring day. 

Advanced Ideas:
- Assess Flood Risk (risk factor?)
- Add additional precipitation
- Switch to HexModelGrid for better overland flow?
- Make snow depth and density spatially variable
